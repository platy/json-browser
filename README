Json Browser
============

Chrome extension to allow browsing of json documents described by JSON schemas.

This is chrome extension wrapping the [jsonary library](jsonary.com) [(github repo)](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsonary) - the main purpose is to render json documents with extra context from their [schema](http://json-schema.org/)

One of the cool things about this is the hyper schema tools which allow the description of links composed from parts of the document which includes form descriptions. This means a json api can be completely interactive and self describing when the appropriate json-schema is provided.
